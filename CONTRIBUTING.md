## Commit Guidelines

Use a simple commit style:
- `feat`: new feature
- `fix`: bug fix
- `docs`: documentation changes
- `refactor`: code refactoring
- `test`: add or update tests
- `chore`: technical tasks

**Example commit message:**
```
feat: add new command handler
```

## Workflow
1. Fork the repository and create a new branch.
2. Make changes and commit them following the rules above.
3. Create a Pull Request with a description of your changes.
4. Document all important changes in CHANGELOG.md.

---
If your contribution is not a bug fix, you must first open an Issue describing your proposal. Only after the proposal is discussed and accepted, you may start working on the implementation.

## Tests
Before submitting changes, make sure all tests pass.

## Documentation
Update README.md and documentation as needed.

---
Main language of the project is **English**. Comments in code can be in Russian, but only using the `#` symbol. Main documentation should be in English.

If you have any questions, open an Issue!
